# Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

# Implement the FreqStack class:

# FreqStack() constructs an empty frequency stack.
# void push(int val) pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.
# int pop() removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
# If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.
