# You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

# You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

# The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
# The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
# Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

# The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

        bulls = 0
        bucket = [0]*10
        
        for s, g in zip(secret, guess):
            if s == g:
                bulls += 1
            else:
                bucket[int(s)] += 1
                bucket[int(g)] -= 1
                
        return f"{bulls}A{len(secret) - bulls - sum(x for x in bucket if x > 0)}B"
