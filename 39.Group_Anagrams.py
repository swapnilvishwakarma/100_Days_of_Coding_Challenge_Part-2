# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: list) -> list:
        h = {}
        
        for word in strs:
            sortedWord = ''.join(sorted(word))
            if sortedWord not in h:
                h[sortedWord] = [word]
            else:
                h[sortedWord].append(word)
                
        final = []
        
        for value in h.values():
            final.append(value)
            
        return final
